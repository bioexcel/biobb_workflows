Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns-type'
Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

NOTE 1 [file p2g.top, line 23]:
  In moleculetype 'Ion' 74 atoms are not bound by a potential or constraint
  to any other atom in the same moleculetype. Although technically this
  might not cause issues in a simulation, this often means that the user
  forgot to add a bond/potential/constraint or put multiple molecules in
  the same moleculetype definition by mistake. Run with -v to get
  information for each atom.


NOTE 2 [file /data/wf_notebook/515206a8-d9ca-4940-a2cc-bf1ab2b9bc81/grompp.mdp]:
  There are 35146 atoms that are fully frozen and part of COMM removal
  group(s), removing these atoms from the COMM removal group(s)

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 0.00

NOTE 3 [file /data/wf_notebook/515206a8-d9ca-4940-a2cc-bf1ab2b9bc81/grompp.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.
