# Protein-ligand Docking tutorials using BioExcel Building Blocks (biobb)

**Using Fpocket binding site predictor.**

***

This tutorial aims to illustrate the process of **protein-ligand docking**, step by step, using the **BioExcel Building Blocks library (biobb)**. The particular example used is based on the **Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14** (p38-Î±) protein (PDB code [3HEC](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3HEC)), a well-known **Protein Kinase enzyme**,
 in complex with the FDA-approved **Imatinib** (PDB Ligand code [STI](https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/STI), DrugBank Ligand Code [DB00619](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00619)) and **Dasatinib** (PDB Ligand code [1N1](https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/1N1), DrugBank Ligand Code [DB01254](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01254)), small **kinase inhibitors** molecules used to treat certain types of **cancer**.

The tutorial will guide you through the process of identifying the **active site cavity** (pocket) without previous knowledge, and the final prediction of the **protein-ligand complex**.
