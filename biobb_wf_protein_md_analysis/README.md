# Protein MD Analysis tutorial using BioExcel Building Blocks (biobb)

***

This workflow computes a set of Quality Control (QC) analyses on top of an uploaded MD trajectory. QC analyses include positional divergence (RMSd), change of shape (<strong>Radius of Gyration</strong>), identification of flexible regions (<strong>atomic/residue fluctuations</strong>), and identification of different molecular conformations (<strong>trajectory clustering</strong>).
