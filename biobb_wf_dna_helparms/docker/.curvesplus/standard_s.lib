# This file defines the backbone torsions to be calculated by Cur+
#
# Standard lines start with a blank and define a single torsion by
# giving 4 atom names (<= 4 chars) followed by the torsion name (<= 6 chars)
#
# Lines starting with 'B' define torsions which depend on the type of base
# Atoms 1-4 are used with purines and atoms 5-8 are used with pyrimidines
#
# Lines starting with 'S' define sugar rings and give the names of the 5 ring
# atoms in the order used for pseudorotation calculations
